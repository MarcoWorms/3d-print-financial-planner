create a js frontend that

- lets me add global config: how much energy costs 
- lets me add my 3d printer data: kw/h spending, printer cost, price/yr to maintain printer, hours up/day, important: I should be able to have more than 1 printer)
- lets me add filament data: name + price per kg
- lets me add project data: filament consumption in grams and hours and minutes it takes to print, how many units are printed, how many units are wasted
- lets me add redistribution channels data: their name the % they take of profit

then I can click one of the models and see a complete view of how much it cost to produce it in each of the printers, how much i need to sell it for to only repay energy + meterial, how much i need to sell it for to repay the printer price in 3,6,9,12,24 months assuming

I can run any comands for you in the command line if needed after you make the important part
